# Homework: Create a madlib. Imagine a story where some of the words are 
# supplied by user input. Using python you will use input to collect 
# words for a story and then display the story. 

# Use input to collect each word to a variable
# Use an f string to display the story

# Your madlib must collect at least 6 words!

place = input("Place: \n")
action = input("Action: \n")
color = input("Color \n")
food = input("Food: \n")
animal = input("Animal: \n")
famous_singer = input("Famous Singer: \n")

print(f"{famous_singer} went to the zoo in {place}, where they saw one {animal} eating some {food}. {famous_singer} started {action} immediately, as their face was bright {color}. After that, {famous_singer} and the {animal} became best friends")
